            <p class="text-justify">
                I grew up surrounded by electronics and technology. I remember learning to use Windows 95 when I was 7 years old and I had a huge desire to click on all the boxes. And that's how I grew up: between DOS games and many discoveries on my own because, at that time, there was no access to YouTube or many tutorials available and I always liked to tinker and learn. And so technology motivated me until I was able to fulfill my dream and work in the IT field. In my second semester of college, I decided to participate in a NASA hackathon and thanks to my dedication in this competition, we won the regional competition. Since then, I have found myself passionate about problem solving.
                Product Manager with a background in design and development. I translate business needs into technical and user-friendly solutions, leading with empathy and creativity.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    I started my career at Inforeis working on the support team. I soon became a team leader and organized the entire department to support the company's biggest product: an omnichannel system with chatbot interaction. After structuring everything, I was invited to participate in other challenges and, as a result, I temporarily left Inforeis. When I returned, I had a new challenge: leading projects for the development team and making the platform grow even more. In my day to day I work with agile methodologies, organizing sprints, monitoring improvements and always keeping in touch with stakeholders.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    During my time at DMS, I led two teams: a DevOps team and a QA team. I learned a lot about CI/CD, server architecture, quality testing, and the best way to manage both teams with a total of 9 interns. I learned a lot about AWS and how to reduce unnecessary costs for the company. It was a period of great discoveries and the chance to, instead of participating in a Hackathon, create one, completely from scratch, for one of the largest universities in Rio de Janeiro in partnership with DMS. We experienced 3 days of many challenges, lots of adrenaline, and many achievements.

                    For a long time, I worked on several projects as a graphic designer and was able to explore the world of user experience. I always had to deal a lot with people and understand their needs. I believe that dealing with my stakeholders has given me a lot of learning about empathetic listening, and going through moments of pressure with deadlines has made me resilient in the need to deliver projects.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    I have always been a person who likes to help the world and I believe that technology is the greatest ally in making this happen. For this reason, during the pandemic, I went to the college labs with a colleague and together we produced more than 250 reusable face shields made on 3D printers to help doctors and nurses have adequate equipment to face COVID-19.
